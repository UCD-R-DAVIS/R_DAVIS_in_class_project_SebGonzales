#Does this relationship maintain or break down as Tyler gets tired? Focus just on post-intervention runs (after July 1, 2024). Make a plot (of your choosing) that shows SPM vs. speed by lap. Use the timestamp indicator to assign lap numbers, assuming that all laps on a given day correspond to the same run (hint: check out the rank() function). Select only laps 1-3 (Tyler never runs more than three miles these days). Make a plot that shows SPM, speed, and lap number (pick a visualization that you think best shows these three variables).
